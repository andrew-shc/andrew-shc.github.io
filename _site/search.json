If you haven’t yet, you will probably start seeing them after. These concepts comes from statistics where they’re called statistical learning, parameter estimation, probabilistic inference, or one of their many synonyms. But what are they? How do they relate to vision? And why is it useful to think about them?\nLet us start with a toy example. We want to design an autonomous system to tell when the car should go or stop, depending on the traffic light. Our dataset are pictures of traffic lights and we want our model \\(M(\\theta)\\) to classify whether an image is \\(\\text{GO}\\) or \\(\\text{STOP}\\) parameterized by \\(\\theta\\). Using one-hot encoding, we let \\(\\mathbf{y}_i:=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}^\\top\\) for \\(\\text{GO}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}_i:=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}^\\top\\) for \\(\\text{STOP}\\). Let red and yellow light be \\(\\text{STOP}\\) and green light be \\(\\text{GO}\\) for our intents and purposes.\n\n\n\n1\n1 Image copied from here\n\nTo simplify our case even more, let us abstract away the high-dimensional input of an image and let \\(\\mathbf{x}_i:=\\begin{bmatrix} x_r & x_y & x_g \\end{bmatrix}^\\top\\), where each component \\(\\in[0,1]\\) corresponds to a snapshot of the illumination intensity of red \\(x_r\\), yellow \\(x_y\\), and the green \\(x_g\\) bulb of a traffic light.

In other words, this maximizes the posterior distribution \\(P(\\theta|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})\\) (i.e., the posterior of \\(\\theta\\)). We then use the Bayes’ theorem 5 to get back our likelihood again with an additional prior \\(p(\\theta)\\) 6 with a constant factor \\(\\frac{1}{p(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})}\\) which can be ignored 7.\n5 A commonly used special operation in statistics/probabilities. Check here6 There’s many ways to think about prior \\(p(\\theta)\\). You think of it as a weighting factor of the likelihood that says how likely that likelihood is given the selected \\(\\theta\\). Or, as a balance between data-driven likelihood and previously known (i.e., “prior”) knowledge on how \\(\\theta\\) should behave (e.g., \\(\\theta\\) is likely to be 67 for some reason). Or, as a regularizer where we follow Occam’s razor that the weights should be simple.7 This is a probability over the training data \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}\\).

In fact, this is a summation of each prediction \\(p(y^*|x^*,\\theta)\\) from all possible parameter \\(\\theta\\) weighted by the posterior for each \\(\\theta\\). The integral can sometimes be computed analytically given a good conjugate prior 9, but most of the time, it is approximated by sampling (i.e., Monte-Carlo).\n8 In statistics, there are two interpretations: frequentist (there’s a single true value and the randomness is strictly from sampling error like MLE/MAP) and Bayesian (there are no true value and the probability is intrinsic).9 A special prior when combined with its corresponding likelihood produces a nice-to-work-with analytical posterior (remember, we are integrating the posterior, which is nasty most of the time).

    "section": "Path-space differentiable rendering (PSDR)",
    "text": "Path-space differentiable rendering (PSDR)\n\n\n\nImage from a course on physics-based differentiable rendering\n\n\nIn rendering, we take a description of a virtual 3D scene and have the renderer produce a 2D image of it given a camera location and orientation. More specifically, a scene has geometry (e.g., meshes, radiance fields) and light sources (or else the image would just be dark) where the renderer merely records the incoming radiance onto an image. So, an image is merely a record of the more complete virtual 3D scene that is easily transferred and displayed without needing to know the complicated underlying scene (e.g., *.ply files) and executing resource-intensive rendering process (e.g., GPUs). In fact, an image is not limited to recording virtual scenes, but it can also record real-life scenes where we usually don’t know the underlying complex environment (e.g., given a photo of a mountain, what is the geometry of the mountain?)1. This is where it gets interesting and how PSDR comes into play. Check the other section to see how PSDR is used in this context.\n1 But remember, a visual record needs light to mediate the underlying complex scene information. (Think exposure time: darker scenes needs longer time to capture the same amount of light to produce a sufficient visual record of a scene, whereas brighter scenes just needs shorter time. If a scene is completely dark, you can think of it needing infinite amount of time to produce an equal quality of a photo.)In forward rendering, there are mostly two common methods: rasterization and path tracing (and a mix of both). If we formalize these rendering process as a function, we get \\(I=f(\\theta)\\), where \\(I\\) is the final image, \\(\\theta\\) is the scene parameters (e.g., geometry, cameras), and \\(f\\) is the rendering process. What if we can differentiate it? Like \\(I=\\frac{d}{d\\theta}f(\\theta)\\)? Actually, this question is not too far-fetched in that machine learning has revolutionized in how we model intelligent-like behaviors and optimization, and differentiability is the core idea that enables such learning to take place.\nWe will be focusing on the more physically-plausible path tracing (via path-integral formulation). In this form, differentiating the rendering process produces two terms: interior term and boundary term. You can read more about them on [1], but basically interior term is what we are mainly differentiating against and the boundary term is an important term that accounts for visibility changes, which commonly appears when we differentiate against geometry.\nThis is why differentiation with respect to the geometry are messy and complicated. For geometric reconstruction, the shapes can change, inducing a visibility changes on a rendered image. For estimating camera pose, same thing: potential visibility changes. For moving geometries, same visibility changes. And what do we mean by visibilty changes anyways? When some geometry goes in front of another, we have an occlusion of the geometry in the back. These changes happen on discontinuities, making the differentiation hard. Hence, there’s a lot of current actively-explored topics on computing the derivatives in these fundamental areas.\nAnother important categories of parameter that we differentiate against are colors. More precisely, emission strength of light sources and the modulation by BSDF. No geometry means easier interior term and no boundary term, but that doesn’t mean it is easier.. overall. Sometimes, the light sources have small areas or the BSDF is highly-specular. In these cases, sampling becomes important and there are many active topics in this regards (e.g., variance reduction).\nOriginal paper on PSDR: [1]\n\n[1] C. Zhang, B. Miller, K. Yan, I.

    "text": "Geometric rendering: black holes\n\n\n\nInterstellar (2014)\n\n\nWhen I mean geometric rendering, I specifically mean geometrically interesting light transport. Usually, rendering has always just been straight line, which serves majority of the purposes. And when we generalize the theory of light transport, we usually talk about wave 2 and quantum optics, according to [5], which is still just straight lines. Yes, mirrors, caustics, and diffraction does make it more interesting, but they still bend at a single point, not continuously. One thing pops up in my mind whenever I think of a light ray that continuously bends: black holes. Their force is so strong that it warps the light rays continuously, not just bend it at a single point.\n\n2 The dissertation mentioned how diffraction can occur even around an object. A good example of this is half-plane diffraction, where the lightened side is just bright, but the shadow side still exhibits extra radiance from the bending of the light or even wave-like oscillation under certain conditions. This is different from umbras and penumbras. Took a while to find an example of this effect since most diffraction examples are about apertures and slits, which I feel like is better termed as “through an object.”\n[5] E. Veach, “Robust monte carlo methods for light transport simulation,” PhD thesis, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA, 1998.\n3 There also exists a similarly theory called special relativity, which is a specific case of general relativity. You can read more about here on §7 of the lecture notes. But basically we assume no gravity (hence, no force, no curvatures, and constant velocities) and focus on the spacetime nature of extreme cases in classical physics (e.g., perceived time at light speed).So, I guess a quick teaser (for me and you) with a demo, I will first create a point of singularity and a light path unaffected by it. What would a light path affected by gravitational force be like? We first need to know the theory behind gravity, and currently there are practically only two out there: Newton’s law (for most use cases) and general relativity 3 (for exotic cases). You can probably guess which theory contains the black hole.\nI started with §6: Black Holes, which says there are multiple kind of black holes with the Schwarzschild black hole being the simplest of all. However, this section mostly discuss about proving and understanding the various properties of many kinds of black holes, which will only be useful later on (beyond the scope). §1.3.5: Light Bending is what we care right now, discussing how light bends under Schwarzschild metric (i.e., the foundation for Schwarzschild black hole). By equation 1.54, we get the trajectory of our light ray affected by the gravitational force to be \\(\\frac{d^2u}{d\\phi^2}+u=\\frac{3GM}{c^2}{u^2}\\), where \\(u(\\phi)=\\frac{1}{r(\\phi)}\\) is the inverse polar radius, \\(G\\) is Newton’s gravitational constant (it appears again!), and \\(M\\) is the mass of our object warping the light path 4. I will quickly demo this by evaluating the ODE numerically via Euler’s method.\n4 Recall that light has no mass (i.e., null geodesic), so technically it is not orbiting around the black hole, but just following the spacetime frame itself that’s getting curved by the black hole.I first need to rewrite the second-order ODE \\(\\ddot{u}+u=\\frac{3GM}{c^2}{u^2}\\) (with \\(\\phi\\) as our independent variable) into a systems of first-order ODE for Euler’s method. \\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{u}=v \\\\\n\\dot{v}=\\frac{3GM}{c^2}{u^2}-u \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional ideas:\n\nGravitational lensing (general case of black holes)\nWormholes\nCollision of two black holes\nRed shift\nRelativistic distortion (i.e., camera near the black holes)\nAccretion disk\nSpinning black holes\nCan we use differentiable rendering on an image of a black hole to estimate various parameter of it (e.g., mass)?\n\nJust out of curiosity (there’s definitely a better way)\n\n\nTopics to review:\n\nDifferential Geometry\nGeneral Relativity\nNon-euclidean geometry\nNumerical “solution” to ODE\n\nPersonal opinion: this is very different from the stuff I have done before and feels refreshing, but the math behind it is daunting at the same time.\nWhere graphics and astrophysics meet: paper link"

    "text": "Stochastic geometry\nAs if probability (or this notion of probabilistic stuff) wasn’t enough, stochasticity (or stochastic stuff) is this new kid down the street I have been hearing quite frequently (apart from stochastic gradient descent). Let us answer first on what is stochasticity, and how is it different from “probabilistic”?\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, for something to be stochastic, it means the something involves a random variable, chance, or probability, which actually is just ever more slightly specific then the term “probabilistic.” In other words, they’re quite same. However, from my initial understanding, people generally associate probabilistic model as something that emphasizes more on learning and inference, whereas stochastic model emphasizes more on modelling the randomness (to a certain degree) of what otherwise would be a mostly deterministic evolutionary process over time, space, or any other indexable/ordered objects (i.e., stochastic process).\nNow the phrase “stochastic geometry” should be a bit clearer now, let’s just dive what’s all the buzz with this in these two papers: [7] and [8]. 10 Remember, we should always be asking ourselves whether this “stochastic geometry” is bringing us benefits in one or both aspects while maintaining at least one other aspect: computationally practicality (on current or near future processors) and physically-correct appearances 11.\n10 Actually, the more I’m reading this two papers, the more I am grateful that I have covered volumetric light transport first😅. (Hinting on whats coming up.)11 If we only want physically-correct appearances, we might as well have all the supercomputers in the world to handle all the complex physical phenomenon (which actually uses a ton of statistics for a long time already). If we only want computational practicality, we have rasterization (e.g., vanilla Minecraft, Roblox, Terraria, etc.).\n\n\nFig 1. from [7]\n\n\n[7] focused on generalizing the exponential volumetric transport to solid media to explain how recent works in signed distanced fields 12 have been successful in modelling opaque, solid geometries as stochastic participating media.\n12 SDFs requires some sort of volumetric transport to be rendered directly. There are also marching cubes to convert SDFs into meshes.\n\n\nFrom [8]\n\n\nTheir novelty is mainly in developing an efficient rendering algorithm for a new type of scene representations. While this efficient algorithm is lathered with technical details, the background of their work is interesting: bringing stochasticity into scene geometry to unify all representations into one, which traditionally has a collection of specialized models to render certain geometries (usually surfaces and participating media). This new generalization naturally gives us geometries that are in between the participating media and surfaces known as “mesoscale” geometries. I hope this allows us to additionally model certain appearances in the physical world that would otherwise be difficult (i.e., larger parameter space that fits closer to physically-correct models).\nWhile both papers uses the same particular interpretation of stochastic geometry, known as stochastic implicit surfaces (SIS) via signed distance functions (SDF), [7] emphasizes on one particular case where opaque solids are represented as stochastic participating media due to the rise of NeuS (and indirectly via NeRF), whereas [8] attempts to further generalize all classes of geometries onto a continuum that allows exploration of new materials (that could potentially be useful for physically-correct geometric modelling).\n\n[7] B. Miller, H. Chen, A. Lai, and I. Gkioulekas, “Objects as volumes: A stochastic geometry view of opaque solids,” in Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), 2024, pp. 87–97.\n\n[8] D.

In reality, this idea has sort of been implicitly used in a lot of places already (e.g., NeuS) and mostly serves as a theoretical interest. But if we see stochastic geometry as a way to generalize material models, I think this is something cool to see it work on a toy example."

Currently, there are two notable domains of problems that fits well into light-transport: inverse rendering (via differentiable rendering) and PDE solvers.\n\nInverse Rendering\nRendering \\(f\\) is all about capturing lights from known scene description \\(\\theta\\) into images \\(I\\) right 13? \\(I=f(\\theta)\\)\n13 As mentioned in the first sectionCamera \\(C\\) is all about capturing lights via real physical process from unknown scene description \\(\\phi\\) into images \\(I'\\) right? \\(I'=C(\\phi)\\)\nWhat if we want to find the unknown \\(\\phi\\)?\nIf \\(f\\approx C\\) 14, we can minimize the difference between the two images via optimization to find the optimal scene description \\(\\theta\\) that best estimates \\(\\phi\\), where \\({\\arg\\min}_\\theta I-I'={\\arg\\min}_\\theta f(\\theta)-C(\\phi)\\).

But in PDEs, solutions are much more interesting to think about and visualize since a large part of is solving them numerically15. Common methods includes finite element method (FEM) and boundary element method (BEM), but they all have tradeoffs, especially when we want to query a value in the interior. However, we can use Walk on Spheres to find the value more efficiently from the principles of light transport and computer graphics.\n15 Actually, there’s some interesting analytical solutions and analysis in ODEs/PDEs such as Laplace and Fourier transformation.\n[9] R.

A lot of them are heuristics, but two main ones are under-reconstruction and over-reconstruction, both derived from view-space positional gradients (i.e., what direction should the original gaussian move to minimize the error). If the gaussian is small and in under-reconstructed region, they just make a clone and move it along the original gaussian splat’s view-position gradient. If the gaussian has a high-variance and is in over-reconstructed region, then just use the original gaussian as PDF for sampling the next two gaussian’s position with smaller size.\nThe problem of Structure from Motion is how can we estimate camera poses and world geometry (usually point clouds) just from images?

    "text": "Rendering exotic light sources: cold-cathode fluorescent displays (CCFDs)\n\n\n\nNixie Tubes\n\n\nI am a big fan of retro technologies, especially the warm neon lights of the bygone days. A year ago, I bought this (it’s a bit pricey) just out of fascination of what it looks like in real life. Unfortunately, it has this distinctive blue overtone which is missing when taking a photo with a consumer device (which makes it all of more interesting). Now, I’m curious if it’s possible to replicate this warm fuzzy feeling of a Nixie tube into computer rendering. There are three approaches to this with increasing level of complexity: emissive solid (i.e., a mesh with an emissive material), emissive participating media, or physically accurate simulation of CCFDs. I’ll mostly be approaching it from the emissive participating media and a bit of physically-accurate modelling (i.e., physically-plausible CCFDs).\nSo how does one go about rendering the warm tone of CCFDs? Are they even always in an orange tone? How do they work? I’ve came across this Google Group discussing about a book “Cold Cathode Glow Discharge Tubes”, by GF Weston from 1968, available in PDF which has a wealth of information in how CCFDs work and their physical properties. Unfortunately, there were not a lot of discussion in optical properties (of this book and elsewhere I can find) that are important in rendering CCFDs. It is most likely because these electrical discharges (hence, light) from excited gasses produce all sorts of colors that are very sensitive to various parameters such as gas pressure, cathode-anode distance, voltage, amperage, gas composition, material used in for cathodes/anodes, etc. Since I’m not here to physically simulate what CCFDs would look like from these various parameters, I’ll be focusing on Nixie tubes (which has more information usually) and maybe a limited range of parameters (it’s still interesting to see how CCFDs would evolve over certain parameters).\n\n\n\nFig 3.2 of “Cold Cathode Glow Discharge Tubes”\n\n\nCCFDs can just be an emissive participating media with an assigned color of orange, but that’s no fun, since there are also various color overtones it produces depending on the gas composition that would be missing. Hence, I am having the input to just be the gas composition and some basic geometric model of the energy field (i.e., the emission surrounding the shape of the cathode or the cathode sheathed in a layer of emission5). Unfortunately, it seems like most Nixie Tube discussion lack the information on their visual properties. So, we turn to the physics of light in hopes of simulating the same physically correct emission of gas composition like shown in the picture. To get there, we need to know some radiative transfer theory, which is readily talked about in [6, Ch. 11] for volumetric scattering process and more completely in [6, Ch. 14] with the introduction of the radiative transfer equation.\n5 Sometimes, the negative glow is shown sticking onto the cathode. In other times, we have two dark spaces with three regions of emission from the cathode side (before the Faraday dark space). The geometries of emission can be quite sensitive, so we will assume the “negative glow” is sticked/sheathed onto the cathode.6 As I look into this & the Nixie Tubes more, there are many more physical abstraction you can uncover (e.g., electrical glow discharge, fluorescent bulbs, anisotropic absorption/out-scattering, etc.), which at a certain point, you’re just modelling electromagnetic waves themselves. In my opinion, we model the most physically-grounded renderer as much as possible while also keeping it fast, so given some known discrete scene parameters, we can render a realistic image in a computationally-sensible way. I hope this is what graphics is all about.In computer graphics, rendering volumetric effects requires us to at least model three main 6 physical process: absorption, emission, and scattering (further broken down as in-scattering and out-scattering). By assumption, we model these effects as differential equations (ordered as emission, absorption, out-scattering, and in -scattering):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ndL_o(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{\\omega}) &= \\sigma_a(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{\\omega}) L_e(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{\\omega})dt \\\\\ndL_o(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{\\omega}) &= -\\sigma_a(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{\\omega}) L_i(\\mathbf{x},-\\mathbf{\\omega})dt \\\\\ndL_o(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{\\omega}) &= -\\sigma_s(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{\\omega}) L_i(\\mathbf{x},-\\mathbf{\\omega})dt \\\\\ndL_o(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{\\omega}) &= \\sigma_s(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{\\omega})\\int_{S^2} p(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{\\omega},\\mathbf{\\omega}_i)L_i(\\mathbf{x},\\omega_i)d\\omega_i dt \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(dL_o(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{\\omega}):=L_o(\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{\\omega}dt, \\mathbf{\\omega})\\) and \\(L_o(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{\\omega}):=L_i(\\mathbf{x},-\\mathbf{\\omega})\\) (remember that we are only traversing the volumetric media in a straight line to simplify our model).\n\\(\\sigma_a\\) is the absorption coefficient and \\(\\sigma_s\\) is the extinction coefficient, and \\(p\\) is the phase function—the BSDF reciprocal of volumetric scattering.\nSo, if we rewrite the formulas, the combined differential change in radiance at a point \\(\\mathbf{p}'=\\mathbf{p}+t\\mathbf{\\omega}\\) in a volumetric media is \\(\\frac{d}{dt}L_o(\\mathbf{p}',\\mathbf{\\omega})=-\\sigma_t(\\mathbf{p}',\\mathbf{\\omega})L_i(\\mathbf{p}',-\\mathbf{\\omega})+\\sigma_t(\\mathbf{p}',\\mathbf{\\omega})L_s(\\mathbf{p}',\\mathbf{\\omega})\\). The \\(\\sigma_t=\\sigma_a+\\sigma_s\\) is the extinction/attenuation coefficient, and in this case it can be interpreted as the medium’s density, where larger value means more effect from the medium while lower value means less effect (i.e., transparent air). Notably, the first term includes the transmittance, which can be analytically 7 solved into \\(e^{-\\sigma_t d}\\) where \\(d\\) is the distance 8. Additionally, in [6], Equation 11.10, they mysteriously used the indirect \\(T_r(\\mathbf{p}+t\\omega\\to\\mathbf{p}')\\) instead of the more direct \\(T_r(\\mathbf{p}\\to\\mathbf{p}+t\\omega)\\), but are equivalent with a change of variable. This can be thought of finding the optical depth/thickness from \\(0\\to t\\) or remainder of the optical thickness from \\(t \\to d\\) (the inner transmission integral).\n7 Assuming homogenous media (i.e., constant density).8 This is better known as the exponential volumetric transport, which is commonly seen in NeRF and NeuS. A natural question to ask is whether non-exponential volumetric transport exist? In fact, it does. The volumetric transport we, and the book, implicitly assume is the Beer-Lambert law., whereas non-exponential version opens a whole can of worms. Both all are governed by the generalized radiative transfer equation (RTE).\n[6] M. Pharr, W. Jakob, and G. Humphreys, Physically based rendering, fourth edition: From theory to implementation. MIT Press, 2023.

Just makes the math cleaner without restricting anything.To actually render volumetric effect, we need a volumetric integrator that generalizes the volumetric scattering effect as a path -integral formulation. The general idea is simple: we just generalize the formulation where the domain include medium locations instead of just surface locations and the measure extended to measure positions of volumetric effect. The contribution function is extended to support phase functions (i.e., in-scattering effects), transmittance (i.e., absorption and out-scattering), and emission 9.\n\nAs I’m writing this out, I also realized clouds is another form volumetric media I want to see it work. Not just a static cloud, but like maybe some procedural noise or even a simple fluid simulation going to see the clouds grow and shrink over time.\nAdditional ideas:\n\nFluid simulation of clouds?\nAccurately render the emission spectrum described from a molecular composition?\n\nTopics to review:\n\nRadiative transfer equation (RTE)\nBeer’s Lambert Law\nFluid dynamics\nSampling volumetric light transports\n\nPersonal opinion: I think this follows more on traditional computer graphics for good reason, volumetric media is common and knowing it is useful (and it’s also fun).\nOriginally wanted to model some exotic light sources, but realized they are quite a complex physical process. This section (i.e., the topic) is probably more aptly named as volumetric light transport. Good thing I did this so I have a better idea what the project could look like."
